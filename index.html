                <p>This isn’t a menu. This is the manifesto of the greasy, the melted, the oozing and the dripping. A tribute to burgers that ruins your shirt but saves your palate. Our adoration of melted cheese and meat juices knows no bound - simply here to celebrate the types of burgers that make your brain short-circuit for a second. If you have stepped into this corner of the internet for healthy, clean, kale-filled diets, I advise you turn back. If not, welcome - to a world of stacked-high, smashed-hard, bacon-laced beauties.</p>

                        A proper burger doesn’t care about finesse — it cares about flavour. It should hit you with smoke, salt, fat, and fire. Instead of being shy and steamed, the patty should be smashed and caramelized. Instead of melting gently, the cheese should drip like lava. And don’t ever think we’re discriminating against our other proteins. Every element should fight for your attention, then somehow work together in greasy harmony. For far too long, burgers have been tamed — polished, portioned, and made to behave. Turned into bland fast-food clones or overpriced, overthought gastropub experiments. Somewhere along the way, people forgot what made burgers great in the first place. They’re not supposed to be neat. They’re not supposed to be refined. They’re supposed to make you feel something. We built this site as a rebellion against the dry, the dull, and the diet-friendly. Because burgers deserve better — and so do you.
